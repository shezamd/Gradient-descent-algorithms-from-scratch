In this assignment, I built a linear regression models to predict admission likelihood of a Masters Programs candidate based on some independent variables such as GRE and TOEFL scores, University Rating, Undergraduate GPA, etc. The dataset is available at this Kaggle data repository () and the paper describing the data is (Acharya et al. 2019). 
To achieve this, standard gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent were implemented from scratch.
